# Data Science

## About
Stuff from courses at University of Wroclaw:
  * Machine Learning
  * Data Mining
  * Deep Learning and Neural Networks
  * Evolutionary Algorithms

And my own projects.

## Notebooks issue
Sometimes jupyter notebooks doesn't render.
Use this in case https://nbviewer.jupyter.org.
